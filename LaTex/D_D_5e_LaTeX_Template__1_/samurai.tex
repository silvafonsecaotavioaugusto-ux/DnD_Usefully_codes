\section{The Samurai}

\DndDropCapLine{S}{tanding alone beneath a barren ladscape, a human faces down a legion of Orc 
    soldiers with a single blade in hand, his liege, a 10-year old princeling, 
    quivering behind him.}
\\ 
Hidden in the shadows of a mansion's ceilling, an elevn spy watches a gathering
of lords having a wat council, taking notes on their battle strategies.
He keeps his set of bizarre equipment close to him, ready to scape at a moment's 
notice.
\\    
Talismans in hand, a dragonborn priest summons spirit animals that hold down a 
demon-possessed civilian. A blaze of fire suddenly silences de demon's cries, as 
he finally draws out the creature that's been terrorizing the village.
\\    
Beholden by an oath no dissimilar to a knight, Samurai pledge their services to 
a single individual, devoting their life to their cause. No matter the vast 
diferrences in treir chosen lord, Samurai undergo a specialized training that 
focus on a certain set of skills, skills that are sometimes as varied as the lord 
they choose to serve. Whether skilled warriors who master the art of the blade, 
subterfuge experts trained in gathering intel and assassination, or learned 
arcanists who channel divine energy through esorteric implements, Samurai are 
renowned and respected by their unering dedication to their craft.

\subsection{A loyal Vassal}
Samurai more often than not, enter into the service of a lord when they begin their 
training. Perhabs they're apprenticed indo the lord of the land, or a family member 
has taken them up for training, whichever the case, Samurai spend their early training 
days working closely with their liege.
\\
\\
\\
Their oath is bound by honor. Thus, they perform their services until their death and 
nothing would bring a Samurai greater shame than being dishonorably dismissed. Their 
master's death is no reason for a Samurai's duty to ente either.
Most Samurai pass on their services to their master's family, or to someone that their 
ma+ster deems close. A few of them become lords themselves and even fewer settel down 
and retire.

\end{DndComment}

\subsection{Distant Wanderers}
In an event that a Samurai becomes without a lord, they might prefer to continue their 
duties on their own, drifting from one place to another, only stopping at an area to 
replenish their supplies or take a brief respite.

These Samurai are referred to as \textbf{Ronin}, someone who finds the way without 
belonging to one place. They can often be seen living and traveling amongst the commonfolk,
assisting them in times of trouble and defending their vilages from bandits and raiders.

These Samurai live a simpler life, but their hearts remain ready for the call of adventure.
